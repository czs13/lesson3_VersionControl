            <p class="lead">Team members may come across a problem when simultaneously working on a file or if there are multiple versions or names of one file.  Things can get confusing fast, which is where Version Control comes into play.  Version control is one main storage for all project files.  It allows multiple people to check files out at the same time without having to worry about overwriting files.  This system also notes who changed files, when 
they were changed, what was changed about them, and even when files were merged.  It can even revert back to an old version of a file and backs files up so that no work is lost!

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GIT is the main system used for version control.  It is a “free open source” distributed system that allows one to create local branches, multiple work flows, along with many other benefits such as aiding in a faster and smoother process.  It is very convenient because every user has their own copy from the remote repository on their local repository, so you can work offline and there is no single point of failure.  It is easy to learn and many popular sites like Google, Microsoft, and Netflix use the GIT version control system.  There are multiple commands for GIT, but the three most common and/or vital commands are Add, Commit, and Push.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A remote repository is “a repository that resides on a remote server shared among multiple team members” while a local repository “resides on a local machine of an individual.”  In other words, the local repository is the singular, individual unit that uploads to the housing unit, the remote repository. There are two ways to create a local repository.  You can either create on from scratch or duplicate an already existing remote repository to your individual local machine.  So, team members can create or pull a file to their Local Repository to revise them, and then commit them back to the Remote Repository when they are finished. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">GIT Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are five basic GIT commands: “git init”, ”git add”, “git commit”, “git log”, and “git status” as well as three remote commands: “git remote”, “git pull”, and “git push”.  The three most important commands however are add, commit, and push.  The command “add” lets the system know to add a local file to a staging system, also known as a cache.  From there, you can “commit” the file, which means to move the file to the local repository.  Then eventually, after revisions have been done for example, you would “push” the file, or move it to the remote repository.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Status of files in GIT</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">One thing about GIT is that as you are editing files, it identifies them as modified.  Once you are done, you can stage the file, so that it re-labels the file as “unmodified.  This creates a cycle in which an unmodified file becomes modified during the editing process until it is finished and staged.  It is then reconsidered unmodified.  To check the state of a file, you can use the “git status” command.  Git will not include untracked files to commit snapshots unless it is specifically told to and will warn you of an untracked file when you check the status.</p>
